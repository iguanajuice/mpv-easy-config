This is a simple pre-made config for mpv that includes a few useful scripts plus much needed out-of-the-box tweaks, such as:

* Use hardware acceleration when available
* Left-click on video to pause
* Disables scroll to seek (helps to not accidentally scrub the video)
* Arrow up/down to change volume (emulates the behavior of Youtube's player)

Use this config by copying `mpv` to `~/.config/`
